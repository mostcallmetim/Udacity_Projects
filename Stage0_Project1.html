<h1>Core Concepts</h1>

<h3>How The Web Works</h3>
	<p> The web or internet is a series of computers that communicate with each other through servers. When you go to a www.google.com for example your browser requests that web page's HTML document from the server and then displays it on your screen. Check out the video below from <a href="http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com/01-not-tubes/">Don't Fear the Internet.com</a> for more details.</p>

	<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. HTML documents contain text that the browser can read and then display as a web page. Check out the video below for more details</p>

<h3>Inline Vs. Block</h3>
	<p>Finally HTML elements are either inline or block. Block differs itself from inline in that block elements form an "invisible block" in which to display content. In the previous video you already may remembering hearing about some these elements known as divs or spans.</p>
